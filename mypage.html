    <h1>Lemay, Brian</h1>
    <p>I'm originally from Rapid City, SD.  I joined the Navy when I was 19 years old and served as a Navy SEAL for 13 years. <br>
         I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter in my free time. I'm studying Computer Science to add to my resume
          and work in the Tech industry.</p>
